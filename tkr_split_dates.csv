# ~/sa/tkr_split_dates.csv
# This file is a demo of a file I use to collect split dates of tickers.
# Once this file is up to date,
# I use a script to read this file and issue a series of 
# UPDATE commands to make closing_price in ydata suitable for
# creating moving average calculations.

# Originally I wanted to separate the three columns with comma.
# But now I like plain white space.

# Some of the data below was obtained from ~/sa/qry_abrupt.sql
# Some was obtained from google of 'stock split dates.'

# Format:
# ticker  date  old_price/new_price
